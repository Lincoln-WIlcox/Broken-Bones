# Broken Bones

## Main Concept
You work for a museum with low standards, and your job is to glue together dinosaur bones in whatever recognizable way possible.

### Features:
1. Bones come on table somehow - `Done`
1. Sticker like-bone placement - `Done`
1. Name dinosaurs - `Done`
1. you make exhibits - `Done`
	- 3 dinos are an exhibit
1. Timer limits how long you have before you fail - `Not Started`
	1. Timer doesn't start until you drag first piece - `Not Started`
	1. Progress bar type timer - `Done`
	1. When timer runs out, you lose your dinosaur bones and get no points - `Not Started`

### Ideas:
- Points
- When you place bones you can't move them again
- Pedestals in background with your previous creations
- Drone flies bones away
- you are rated on those exhibits
